# Verishda

Welcome to Verishda, the app that tells who who is at your favourite place. The name stems from a swabian German phrase for 'who's there?'.

The project is built in 100% pure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and consists of a client and a server. The project is set up as a workspace, see the source for details.

The main components are:
* [Verishda Server](verishda-server/README)
* [Verishda Client](verishda-slint/README)
