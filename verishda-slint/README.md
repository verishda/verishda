# Verishda Slint

This is the cross platform client app for Verishda, written using [Slint UI](https://slint.dev). The client aims to be cross platform, however, currently only Windows is working 100% (on MacOS and Linux, location tracking isn't working yet, which prevents Verishda's main feature).

The app shares the configuration infrastructure with the server, see [the configuration subproject](../verishda-config/README) for details.
